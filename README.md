### What I learned
This was really a good challenge. I learnt a lot about  styling lists using pseudo elements.

### Continued development
I need to improve creating tables and styling pseudo elements.

### Useful resources
- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_lists.asp).
- [pseudo elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::marker) I had to read this for styling those elipsis and bolded texts on the lists. Once I figured out for preparation, it was easy to for ingredients and instruction section. 
- [Table](https://www.htmltables.io/) easier to create tags for table. I usually mess up with `tr` and `td`. This was useful to some extend to create the table, number of rows and columns.
